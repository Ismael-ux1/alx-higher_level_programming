Python - More Classes and Objects


Description

In this project, I further explored classes and objects in Python, focusing on the implementation of special methods such as __str__ and __repr__. I also practiced working with class attributes, instance methods, and static methods. Additionally, I tackled the N queens puzzle to find all possible solutions for placing non-attacking queens on a chessboard.

What I Learned
- Implementing special methods __str__ and __repr__ for custom string representations of objects.
- Working with class attributes and instance methods.
- Utilizing static methods for class-related functionality.
- Solving complex puzzles and problems using Python.

Tasks

   [0-rectangle.py](0-rectangle.py): Empty Python class that defines a rectangle.

   [1-rectangle.py](1-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes width and height. It allows instantiation with optional width and height and performs validation.

   [2-rectangle.py](2-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a public instance method area to calculate the area and a public instance attribute perimeter to calculate the perimeter.

   [3-rectangle.py](3-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a special method __str__ to print the rectangle with the # character.

   [4-rectangle.py](4-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a special method __repr__ to return a string representation of the rectangle.

   [5-rectangle.py](5-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a special method __del__ to print a message when a rectangle is deleted.

   [6-rectangle.py](6-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a public class attribute number_of_instances to count the number of instances created.

   [7-rectangle.py](7-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a public class attribute class_symbol for custom string representation.

   [8-rectangle.py](8-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a static method bigger_or_equal to compare rectangles based on their area.

   [9-rectangle.py](9-rectangle.py): Python class that defines a rectangle with a class method square to create a square instance.

   [ 101-nqueens.py](101-nqueens.py): Python program to solve the N queens puzzle, finding all possible solutions for placing non-attacking queens on a chessboard of size NxN.
