Python - Classes and Objects


Description

This project introduced me to the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. I explored key OOP principles such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation. Through the implementation of classes and objects, I gained valuable experience in creating and working with objects, defining classes, and using various object-oriented techniques to solve problems efficiently.
What I Learned

    Understanding and applying the principles of Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation in Python.
    Creating and defining classes to represent objects and their behavior.
    Implementing methods and attributes within classes to perform specific tasks.
    Leveraging object-oriented concepts for organized and efficient code.

Tasks

   [0-square.py](0-square.py)
        Python class Square that defines a square.

   [1-square.py](1-square.py)
        Python class Square that defines a square with a private instance attribute size. It allows instantiation with size.

   [2-square.py](2-square.py)
        Python class Square that builds on the previous task and adds size validation. It raises exceptions if size is not an integer or is less than 0.

   [3-square.py](3-square.py)
        Python class Square that calculates and returns the area of a square.

   [3-square.py](4-square.py)
        Python class Square with a property size to access and update the private instance attribute size.

   [5-square.py](5-square.py)
        Python class Square with a method my_print that prints the square with the character '#' to standard output.

   [6-square.py](6-square.py)
        Python class Square that adds a private instance attribute position. It allows instantiation with optional size and position. It raises exceptions if the provided position attribute is not a tuple of two positive integers.

   [100-singly_linked_list.py](100-singly_linked_list.py)
        Python classes Node and SinglyLinkedList that define a singly-linked list. The Node class includes data and next_node attributes, while the SinglyLinkedList class allows creating and sorting linked lists.

   [101-square.py](101-square.py)
        Python class Square that sets the printing of a Square instance equivalent to my_print().

   [102-square.py](102-square.py)
        Python class Square that defines methods for comparing two square instances based on their areas using logical operators.

   [103-magic_class.py](103-magic_class.py)
        Python function matching exactly a bytecode.
