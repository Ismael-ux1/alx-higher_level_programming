Python - import & modules

Description:

In this project, I worked with Python modules, imported functions from external files, handled command-line arguments, and performed various tasks that involved importing and using modules efficiently. I also delved into more advanced topics like handling bytecode and explored different ways to print output without standard Python constructs.


What I Learned:

    Importing Functions: I learned how to import functions from external Python files and use them in my programs.

    Handling Command-Line Arguments: I gained experience in handling command-line arguments, allowing my Python scripts to be more flexible and dynamic.

    Exploring Modules: I explored modules and discovered how to list defined names within compiled modules.

    Basic Calculator: I created a simple calculator program that imported functions to perform arithmetic operations based on user input.

    Output Manipulation: I learned how to manipulate and print output in creative ways, including printing without using traditional print statements.

    Bytecode Understanding: I gained insight into Python bytecode and how to match it with Python functions.

    Optimized Output: I explored ways to optimize the printing of the alphabet in uppercase without using common programming constructs.



Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

    Import a simple function from a simple file (0-add.py): Python program that imports the add function from add_0.py and prints the result of adding 1 and 2.

    My first toolbox! (1-calculation.py): Python program that imports functions from a file and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 10 and 5.

    How to make a script dynamic! (2-args.py): Python program that prints the number of its arguments and lists them.

    Infinite addition (3-infinite_add.py): Python program that prints the result of adding all its arguments.

    Who are you? (4-hidden_discovery.py): Python program that prints names defined in a compiled module (hidden_4.pyc) in alphabetical order, excluding names starting with '__'.

    Everything can be imported (5-variable_load.py): Python program that imports the variable a from variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

    Build my own calculator! (100-my_calculator.py): Python program that imports functions from calculator_1.py and handles basic operations (+, -, *, /) based on user input.

    Easy print (101-easy_print.py): Python program that prints "#pythoniscool" without using print, eval, open, or sys.

    ByteCode -> Python #3 (102-magic_calculation.py): Python function that matches a provided bytecode.

    Fast alphabet (103-fast_alphabet.py): Python program that prints the alphabet in uppercase without using loops, conditionals, str.join(), string literals, or system calls.
