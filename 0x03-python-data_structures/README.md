# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
In this project, I learned about fundamental data structures in Python, including lists and tuples. I practiced various operations such as element access, replacement, and deletion in lists. Additionally, I explored string manipulation, multiple return values, and CPython integration. This project provided valuable experience in working with data structures and enhancing problem-solving skills.

### What I Learned
- Manipulating Python lists and tuples effectively.
- Handling edge cases when accessing, replacing, or deleting elements.
- String manipulation to remove specific characters.
- Returning multiple values from Python functions.
- Basic C programming for Python interaction.
- Enhancing problem-solving skills for data manipulation.
