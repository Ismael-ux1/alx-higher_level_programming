Python - Hello, World

*Description:
In the "Python - Hello, World" project, I learned various fundamental concepts in Python programming through a series of scripting tasks. These tasks provided valuable hands-on experience with Python syntax, string manipulation, printing, I/O operations, and more. Additionally, the project included a C programming task that required implementing a cycle detection algorithm for linked lists.


What I learned:

    Python Script Execution: Through tasks like "Run Python File" and "Run Inline," I became proficient in running Python scripts both from files and inline, demonstrating command-line script execution.

    Basic Output: The "Hello, print" task allowed me to practice using the print function to display messages and grasp basic Python syntax.

    String Manipulation: Several tasks, such as "Print integer," "Print float," "Print string," and "Play with strings," enhanced my string manipulation skills. I learned about string concatenation, formatting, and repetition.

    Variable Handling: In "Copy - Cut - Paste" and "Create a new sentence," I explored variable creation and directly printing concatenated strings, reinforcing variable management techniques.

    Python Philosophy: The "Easter Egg" task introduced me to "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, providing insights into Python's programming philosophy.

    C Programming: "Linked list cycle" involved C programming and algorithmic thinking, allowing me to implement a cycle detection algorithm for linked lists.

    Error Handling: The "Hello, write" task highlighted error handling by printing to the standard error stream (stderr) and setting specific exit codes.

    Bytecode Compilation: I learned about bytecode compilation in the "Compile" task, where I created a Python script to compile source files into bytecode files (.pyc).

    Advanced Python: In "ByteCode -> Python #1," I delved into advanced Python concepts by reverse engineering bytecode and implementing a Python function to reproduce its functionality.



Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

    Run Python File (0-run): This task involves creating a Bash script that runs a Python script file specified by the environment variable $PYFILE. It demonstrates running Python scripts from the command line.

    Run Inline (1-run_inline): In this task, you'll create a Bash script that executes Python code saved in the environment variable $PYCODE. It showcases running Python code inline.

    Hello, print (2-print.py): This Python script prints a specific message using the print function, emphasizing basic Python syntax.

    Print integer (3-print_number.py): You'll create a Python script to print an integer along with a string, showcasing string concatenation.

    Print float (4-print_float.py): In this task, you'll print a floating-point number with a specified precision.

    Print string (5-print_string.py): This Python script demonstrates string repetition and substring extraction.

    Play with strings (6-concat.py): You'll concatenate two strings to form a sentence and print it.

    Copy - Cut - Paste (7-edges.py): This task involves extracting specific parts of a string and storing them in new variables, highlighting string manipulation.

    Create a new sentence (8-concat_edges.py): You'll directly print a concatenated string without creating new variables, emphasizing string manipulation.

    Easter Egg (9-easter_egg.py): This Python script prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, introducing you to Python programming philosophy.

    Linked list cycle (10-check_cycle.c): This C task focuses on implementing a cycle detection algorithm for linked lists. It returns 0 if there's no cycle and 1 if there is. It involves C programming and algorithmic thinking.

    Hello, write (100-write.py): This Python script prints a message to the standard error stream (stderr) using the write function and exits with a specific status code.

    Compile (101-compile): In this task, you'll create a Python script to compile a Python source file and generate a bytecode file (.pyc).

    ByteCode -> Python #1 (102-magic_calculation.py): This advanced Python task requires you to reverse engineer a given bytecode and implement a Python function that reproduces the same functionality.
