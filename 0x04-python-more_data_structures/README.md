# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
In this project, I explored the usage of sets and dictionaries in Python, along with advanced functions like lambda, map, filter, and reduce. This project offered practical experience in data manipulation.

### What I Learned
- Effective data manipulation using Python lists and tuples.
- Handling edge cases when accessing, replacing, or deleting elements.
- String manipulation for character removal.
- Returning multiple values from Python functions.
- Basic C programming for Python interaction.
- Enhanced problem-solving skills for data manipulation.

## Tasks
### 0. Squared simple
- Compute the square of integers in a matrix.
- Return a matrix with squared values.

### 1. Search and replace
- Replace occurrences of an element in a new list.

### 2. Unique addition
- Add unique integers in a list.

### 3. Present in both
- Return a set of common elements in two sets.

### 4. Only differents
- Return a set of elements present in only one set.

### 5. Number of keys
- Return the number of keys in a dictionary.

### 6. Print sorted dictionary
- Print a dictionary with keys in alphabetical order.

### 7. Update dictionary
- Replace or add key/value pairs in a dictionary.

### 8. Simple delete by key
- Delete a key in a dictionary.

### 9. Multiply by 2
- Return a new dictionary with values multiplied by 2.

### 10. Best score
- Return a key with the biggest integer value.
- Return None if no score is found.

### 11. Multiply by using map
- Return a list with values multiplied by a number using map.

### 12. Roman to Integer
- Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.

### 13. Weighted average!
- Return the weighted average of integers in a list of tuples.
- Tuple format: (<score>, <weight>).
- Return 0 if the list is empty.

### 14. Squared by using map
- Compute the square value of integers in a matrix using map.
- Return a new matrix with squared values.

### 15. Delete by value
- Delete keys with a specific value in a dictionary.

### 16. CPython #1: PyBytesObject
- C functions that print basic information about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
