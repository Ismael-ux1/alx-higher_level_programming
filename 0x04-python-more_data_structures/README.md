# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
In this project, I explored the usage of sets and dictionaries in Python, along with advanced functions like lambda, map, filter, and reduce. This project offered practical experience in data manipulation.

### What I Learned
- Working with sets and dictionaries efficiently.
- Utilizing lambda, map, filter, and reduce methods.
- Performing operations on sets and dictionaries.
- Enhancing problem-solving skills for data manipulation.
