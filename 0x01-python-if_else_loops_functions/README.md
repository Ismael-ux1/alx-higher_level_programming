Python - if/else, loops, functions


Description:
In the "Python - if/else, loops, functions" project, I gained valuable experience in using conditional statements, loops, and defining functions in Python. These fundamental concepts are essential for building logic and creating efficient, reusable code. The tasks in this project allowed me to practice and apply these concepts in various scenarios.


What I learned:

    Conditional Statements: Tasks like "Positive anything is better than negative nothing" and "The last digit" introduced me to using if/else statements to make decisions based on conditions. I learned how to check for positive/negative numbers and extract the last digit of a number.

    Loops: In "I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game" and "Hexadecimal printing," I practiced using loops to iterate through sequences of characters or numbers. These tasks helped me understand loop control and repetition.

    Function Definition: Tasks such as "islower" and "To uppercase" guided me in defining Python functions. I learned how to create functions that perform specific tasks and return values.

    String Manipulation: The "Remove at position" task honed my skills in string manipulation. I was able to create a new string by removing a character at a specific position.

    Mathematical Operations: "a + b" and "a ^ b" tasks allowed me to implement basic mathematical operations as Python functions. I practiced performing addition and exponentiation without using external modules.

    Control Flow: The "Fizz Buzz" task demonstrated the importance of control flow in solving problems efficiently. I learned how to print specific messages based on the divisibility of numbers.

    Linked Lists (C Programming): In "Insert in sorted linked list," I ventured into C programming and implemented a function to insert numbers into a sorted linked list. This task introduced me to data structures and algorithmic thinking.

    Reverse Order Printing: The "Smile in the mirror" task required me to print characters in reverse order, alternating between uppercase and lowercase. This enhanced my understanding of string manipulation and loop control.

    Advanced Python (Bytecode Manipulation): In "ByteCode -> Python #2," I delved into advanced Python concepts by matching provided bytecode to a Python function. This task challenged me to understand bytecode and replicate its functionality.





Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

    Positive anything is better than negative nothing (0-positive_or_negative.py): Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

    The last digit (1-last_digit.py): Python program that prints the last digit of a random signed number and provides conditions for its value.

    Print the alphabet (2-print_alphabet.py): Python program that prints the lowercase alphabet without a new line, using one print and one loop, without storing characters or importing modules.

    Print the alphabet with exceptions (3-print_alphabt.py): Python program that prints the lowercase alphabet with a new line, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e,' using one print and one loop, without storing characters or importing modules.

    Hexadecimal printing (4-print_hexa.py): Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

    Print numbers (5-print_comb2.py): Python program that prints two-digit numbers from 00 to 99, separated by commas and ending with a new line, using limited print functions and one loop.

    Combinations of two digits (6-print_comb3.py): Python program that prints all possible combinations of two different digits in ascending order, separated by commas, and ending with a new line, using limited print functions and two loops.

    Check for lowercase (7-islower.py): Python function that checks if a character is lowercase and returns True or False without importing modules or using str.upper().
